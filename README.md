# Wizard Battles/Battle of the Arcane
This is a personal project. This is a game idea where wizards fight each other in arenas.

# Concept  
I want this game to be a highly competitive FPS wizard battle. The main game mode will be a 5v5 team deathmatch, where players can be set up with randoms or play with friends, and they will fight to the death and last team standing wins. With customizable players and equipment (including wands, robes, pets) and each spell cost mana causing players to think of their choices. Revivals are there but mana is transferred/split to the dead player. 

Also there has to be physical attacks incase players are out of mana but they are weaker than magic (ofc).

### Game Engine
I am having trouble deciding on what engine should I use. Either Unity or Unreal 4/5 since I am more familiar with Unity but I want the lighting and the look of assets of Unreal. So far I am trying both to see what are the differences and which best fits this game. I also don't know how the multiplayer will go on Unreal.

I'll do more research on what to use since I have to start somewhere and I also don't want to waste time when I have to decide to switch.

# What I Have Now (Unity)
I have created some animations on how the player will swing/attack with their wands. I want to add punching animations and and Inventory System so the player can equip items beforehand.
