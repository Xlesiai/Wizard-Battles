# Wizard Battles/Battle of the Arcane
This is a personal project. This is a game idea where wizards fight each other in arenas.

# Concept  
Immerse yourself in an intense and thrilling FPS wizard battle. Compete with others in a 5v5 team deathmatch, where strategic spell-casting, tactical choices, and teamwork are essential for victory. Customize your wizard with a vast selection of wands, robes, and pets, each with unique abilities and strengths. But choose wisely - every spell you cast requires mana, which adds a new level of strategy to your gameplay. While revivals are possible, mana is split among surviving teammates, making resurrection a difficult decision. Don't worry if you run out of mana - you can resort to physical attacks, although they are less powerful than magic. So gather your friends or join random players for an epic battle of wizards, and may the best team win!

### Game Engine
I am having trouble deciding on what engine should I use. Either Unity or Unreal 4/5 since I am more familiar with Unity but I want the lighting and the look of assets of Unreal. So far I am trying both to see what are the differences and which best fits this game. I also don't know how the multiplayer will go on Unreal.

I'll do more research on what to use since I have to start somewhere and I also don't want to waste time when I have to decide to switch.

# What I Have Now (Unity)
I have created some animations on how the player will swing/attack with their wands. I want to add punching animations and and Inventory System so the player can equip items beforehand.

# What I Have Now (Unreal)
I am starting to go to Unreal for the fact that I've been itching to make a game and computer science classes got me busy with my game dev projcts
