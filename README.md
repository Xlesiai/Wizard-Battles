# Wizard Battles/Battle of the Arcane
This is a personal project. This is a game idea where wizards fight each other in arenas.

# Game

## Concept  
Immerse yourself in an intense and thrilling FPS wizard battle. Compete with others in a 5v5 team deathmatch, where strategic spell-casting, tactical choices, and teamwork are essential for victory. Customize your wizard with a vast selection of wands, robes, and pets, each with unique abilities and strengths. But choose wisely - every spell you cast requires mana, which adds a new level of strategy to your gameplay. While revivals are possible, mana is split among surviving teammates, making resurrection a difficult decision. Don't worry if you run out of mana - you can resort to physical attacks, although they are less powerful than magic. So gather your friends or join random players for an epic battle of wizards, and may the best team win!

## Game Engine
I am having trouble deciding on what engine should I use. Either Unity or Unreal 4/5 since I am more familiar with Unity but I want the lighting and the look of assets of Unreal. So far I am trying both to see what are the differences and which best fits this game. I also don't know how the multiplayer will go on Unreal.

I'll do more research on what to use since I have to start somewhere and I also don't want to waste time when I have to decide to switch.

## Magic Ideas

### Basic Spells
- Basic Attack: A basic attack spell that shoots a normal projectile.
- Fireball: A classic spell that creates a fiery projectile that explodes on impact, dealing damage to enemies in the area.
- Ice Shard: A spell that launches a shard of ice that freezes enemies, slowing them down and making them vulnerable to attacks.
- Lightning Bolt: A powerful spell that strikes a target with lightning, dealing high damage and stunning them, with a small probability to jump.

### Conjuration
- Summon Familiar: A spell that summons a creature to fight alongside the caster, providing support and distraction.

### Debuffs
- Poison Cloud: A spell that creates a poisonous cloud that damages enemies over time and reduces their effectiveness.
- Gravity Well: A spell that creates a gravitational field that push/pulls enemies towards its center, making them easier to hit and control.
- Tracker: A spell that highlights the enemy through walls for X amount of seconds

### Buffs/Self
- Shield: A spell that creates a protective shield around the caster, reducing damage taken and deflecting enemy projectiles.
- Invisibility: A spell that makes the caster invisible, allowing them to move unseen and surprise enemies.
- Teleport: A spell that allows the caster to instantly move to a different location on the map, allowing for quick escapes and flanking maneuvers.

#### Healing
- Healing Aura: A spell that creates a healing field that restores health to allies within the area.


## What I Have Now (Unity)
I have created some animations on how the player will swing/attack with their wands. I want to add punching animations and and Inventory System so the player can equip items beforehand.

## What I Have Now (Unreal)
I am starting to go to Unreal for the fact that I've been itching to make a game and computer science classes got me busy with my game dev projcts
